# ScheduledHarmony #
This is an algorithm for scheduling classes at my former high school that I worked on for over a year and a half. It takes information about student forecasting requests and the classes each teacher is anticipated to teach. Using this data, the algorithm attempts to place students into groups with a given size and assign a teacher to each group. This program is expected to save hundreds of hours spent by staff placing students into classes, as well as increase the percentage of forecasting requests that are granted.

## Documentation ##
In this GitHub repo, you can find a comprehensive instruction manual on how to use the program. This manual is intended to be used by someone with basic knowledge of scheduling high school classes, but not necessarily any computer science experience (eg. a high school counselor). Unfortunately, no further documents or code are available for public viewing at this time.

## What I Learned ##
Working on this project for a year and a half makes this by far the largest project I've completed. Over those two years, I had to constantly re-factor my code to align with new things I was learning about proper C++ programming style. With little formal instruction, most of the knowledge needed for this project was self-taught.

Given these defining characteristics of this experience, I learned:
- How to develop a complex algorithm given unique constraints.
- How to select an algorithmic technique for a specific task.
- How to manage and remain accountable for a large project.
- How to properly employ object-oriented programming to organize a large project.
- How to work with a client's constraints and data formats to provide a user-friendly interface.
- How to parse and process large quantities of data.
- How to document use of a product.
- How to code proficiently in C++.
- How to compile code with CMake.
